# Logistic Regression Advanced Case Study

This project is part of a supervised learning case study focused on binary classification using logistic regression. The goal was to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on patient data.

## Objective

The main objective of this case study was to apply logistic regression to a real-world dataset, evaluate the model’s performance using classification metrics, and interpret the results. I also explored data preparation, model training, evaluation, and discussed the confusion matrix and feature impact.

## Files Included

- `Logistic Regression Advanced Case Study.ipynb`: The complete notebook containing the code, answers to the Checkup Exercises (I–IV), and analysis.
- `heart.xlsx`: The dataset used in the notebook.

## Key Topics Covered

- Logistic Regression modeling
- Data preprocessing
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Handling imbalanced data
- Interpretation of coefficients and decision boundary

## Notes

This notebook follows a structure designed to be reused for similar classification problems in future projects. All required exercises (Checkup Sets I–IV) have been completed.
